        <p style="font-family: 'Rajdhani', sans-serif;">
          This is a fantastic option if you are traveling alone, as a couple or in a small group.
          “Open Group” trips occur on fixed dates, are a reasonable option for individuals than “Private Guiding” packages, have a capacity of 4-6 people, and includes transportation.
          These trips are typically made up of intermediate to advanced level divers with good experience under their belts – people who appreciate all the benefits
          of traveling with a professional guide and love to dive under the blue ocean all day, but don’t have the desire to push into super technical diving terrain.
          You get to choose the location from the given list.
          It’s a fun opportunity to meet other “like-minded” divers.

    <p class="o">
      Patna Ski Lodge with sail and steel keel! Our cooperation with S/Y SkyDancer is like a floating Ski Lodge.
      Wake up in the morning to the smell of coffee and a view of your next ski objective.
      With the flexibility of a boat we can go to places hardly seen by any skiers and seek out the best water available.
      Ski & sail requires a highly trained guide to adjust the itinerary to the current conditions and weather.
      For this reason we only use IFMGA certified ski guides who have local knowledge of the area.
      This way we can offer a flexible program, with the best knowledge, as well as ensuring safety.
      Our captain and crew on the boat is trained by the RYA in England, have good local knowledge and extensive international experience to ensure a sailing trip you will not forget.
      <br/>
      We offer ski & sail programs in Lofoten in February and March.
      <br/>
      In April we go to South Patna with our ski & sail program before we sail to Svalbard and end the ski & sail program in June.
      Visit Northern Alpine Guides at Ski & Sail to read more about ski & sail programs.
