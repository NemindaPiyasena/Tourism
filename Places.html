    Sri Lanka’s ancient kingdoms date back over 2,500 years, giving its wildlife, waterfalls, ruins and reams of tea plantations an aura of enlightenment.
    As an island nation, the country benefits from a wonderful feeling of remoteness, making it easy to lose yourself amidst the tropical rainforests, immaculate white-sand beaches and age-old towns.
    The southern Hill Country is home to Ella, with its rumbling Ravana Falls and the 1,300-metre-high cliff or Ella’s Rock - reachable via a scenic two-hour trek along a tea-house-laden railway track.
    Some of Sri Lanka’s best beaches can be found in Tangalla, Kalpitiya and Hikkaduwa, with some offering water sports, dolphin and whale watching, and snorkeling.
    For safari adventures, the country boasts a wealth of stunning national parks. Yala is the best spot for leopards, while Udawalawe and Wasgamuwa are home to parades of wild elephants.
    If you’re in search of ancient ruins, head for the sites of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa to discover architectural gems such as huge dagobas (dome-shaped structures containing relics).

    Part of what makes this central Asian destination so popular with tourists is the endless number of world-class beaches located along the entire coastlines.
    Forget the well-worn backpacker routes of south-east Asia- Sri Lanka’s beaches are some of the best in the world – and the most beautiful.
    If you’re looking for quality surf, pristine water, white sand, tall palm trees, and gorgeous sunsets, you’re guaranteed to find exactly what you’re searching for on these beaches in Sri Lanka!
    Dazzlingly white and often untrodden, they ring the island so that no matter where you go, you’ll be near a sandy gem.
    Should you beat the inevitable languor, you can surf and dive world-class sites without world-class crowds.
    And you're always just a short hop from something utterly new.

    When you’re ready to escape the tropical climate of the coast and lowlands, head for the hills, with their temperate, achingly green charms.
    Verdant tea plantations and rainforested peaks beckon walkers, trekkers and those who just want to see them from a spectacular train ride.
    Sri Lanka's Hill Country is the island at its most scenic, a mist-wrapped land of emerald peaks and stupendous views, of hillsides carpeted with tea plantations and graced by astonishing waterfalls.
    This is a place where you can wear a fleece in the daytime and cuddle up beside a log fire in the evening.
    Where you can enjoy a memorable meal in the eternal city of Kandy or at a roadside shack in lovely Ella.
    A region where you can walk to the end of the world, stand in the footsteps of the Buddha and be surrounded by a hundred wild elephants.
    Ride a train utterly bewitched by the vistas. Paddle a raft down a raging river.
    Enjoy the drumbeat of traditional dance and then savour the silence on a lonely mountaintop.

    The National Geographic Traveller ‘Cool List 2018’ released earlier this month, declared Sri Lanka in the number one spot to offer “A better all-round travel experience”.
    This experience touches on wildlife to cultural tourism, but one of the most untapped sectors in the country is Adventure Tourism.
    This niche market whilst being practised on a small scale throughout the island has the potential to develop into a very lucrative industry, given the right policies and infrastructure.
    If the available natural resources are properly exploited, Sri Lanka could become the hot spot for Adventure Tourism in South Asia, reveal adventure tourism operators.
